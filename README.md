# docker_ml_ec2
Testing a python ML microservice - containerizing it with Docker on an AWS EC2 linux instance.
It uses simple Flask API to communicate between user input and the trained model.

This microservice uses the legal_text_classification.csv from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amohankumar/legal-text-classification-dataset.
